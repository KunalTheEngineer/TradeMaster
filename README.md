## 📖 Project Overview

TradeMaster is an enterprise-grade backend trading platform developed using **ASP.NET Core Web API** following **Clean Architecture** principles.

The application simulates how modern brokerage and investment platforms manage users, stocks, portfolios, holdings, watchlists, and trade execution through secure REST APIs.

The project demonstrates scalable backend development practices including Repository Pattern, Dependency Injection, JWT Authentication, Entity Framework Core, SQL Server integration, Unit Testing, Logging, and Continuous Integration using GitHub Actions.

The primary objective of this project is to build a production-style backend architecture that reflects real-world financial trading systems.

# 🗄️ Database Schema

TradeMaster uses **SQL Server** as the relational database and **Entity Framework Core (Code First)** for database modeling and migrations.

## Database Entities

| Entity | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Users** | Stores user profile and authentication information |
| **Stocks** | Stores available stocks for trading |
| **Orders** | Records buy and sell orders placed by users |
| **Holdings** | Maintains the current portfolio of each user |
| **Transactions** | Stores completed trade history |
| **Watchlists** | Stores stocks bookmarked by users |

---

Passwords are securely hashed using **BCrypt** before being stored in the database.

---

# 📡 REST API Overview

## Authentication

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/Auth/register` | Register a new user |
| POST | `/api/Auth/login` | Authenticate user and generate JWT |

---

# 🔍 Search, Sorting & Pagination

TradeMaster supports efficient querying for large datasets.

### Pagination

```
GET /api/Stock?pageNumber=1&pageSize=10
```

### Search

```
GET /api/Stock?search=TCS
```

---

### Sorting

```
GET /api/Stock?sortBy=price&sortOrder=desc
```

---

### Combined Query

```
GET /api/Stock?pageNumber=1&pageSize=10&search=Reliance&sortBy=currentPrice&sortOrder=asc
```


# 📄 Sample API Response

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "symbol": "TCS",
  "companyName": "Tata Consultancy Services",
  "currentPrice": 3725.50
}
```

# 🚀 Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- .NET 8 SDK
- SQL Server
- Visual Studio 2022 / Visual Studio Code
- Git
- Docker Desktop *(Optional)*

---

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/TradeMaster.git
cd TradeMaster
```

---

## Configure the Database

Update the connection string in `appsettings.json`.

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER;Database=TradeMaster;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
}
```

If using SQL Server Authentication:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER;Database=TradeMaster;User Id=sa;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
}
```

---

## Apply Entity Framework Migrations

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

---

## Run the Application

```bash
dotnet run
```

The API will be available at:

```
https://localhost:5001
```

or

```
http://localhost:5000
```

depending on your launch profile.

---

# 📖 Swagger API Documentation

Once the application is running, open:

```
https://localhost:5001/swagger
```

Swagger provides interactive documentation for all REST endpoints, allowing developers to test APIs directly from the browser.

---

# 🧪 Unit Testing

TradeMaster includes automated unit tests using **xUnit** and **Moq**.

Run all tests:

```bash
dotnet test
```

The test suite validates:

- Repository methods
